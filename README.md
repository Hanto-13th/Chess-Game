# Chess Game in Python with Pygame

Hello, this is my first personnal project of programming.
I do this to show my work and capacities, I hope live with that in my future.
Work Duration: A month and a half

This is a chess game implemented in Python using the Pygame library.  
It supports all standard chess rules, including:  
- Piece movements (pawn, rook, bishop, knight, queen, king)  
- Check, checkmate, and stalemate detection  
- Castling, promotion (using the python shell), and en passant captures  
- Simple graphical interface with board and pieces display

It's just a simple programm, but i hope you enjoy it !
